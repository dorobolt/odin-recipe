    <h2><em>Crispy Fried Chicken</em></h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks
        to<br>

    <p></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong><br>Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts,
            <br>drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery store.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong><br>Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too
            tough.<br>Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken. </li>
        <li><Strong>Flour</Strong><br>All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to,
            <br>while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong><br>This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with
            browning), <br>salt, and pepper. You can add more spices and seasonings to taste. </li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong><br>Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point. </li>

    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Direction</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the breading</strong><br>Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal
            the bag and shake until well-combined. </li>
        <li><strong> Dredge the Chicken </strong><br>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both
            sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk. <br>Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour
            mixture,
            seal, and shake well to coat.Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover.<br> Allow the flour
            coating to become a paste-like consistency.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Chicken</strong><br>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken
            on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes.<br> Remove the cover,
            return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels. </li>
    </ol>
